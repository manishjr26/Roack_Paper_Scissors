# Roack_Paper_Scissors
  This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game in Java. The game allows two players (the user and the computer) to make their choices between Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. The game continues until the user decides to stop playing.

# Features:
    * Allows the user to play against the computer in a series of Rock Paper Scissors rounds.
    * Implements random selection for the computer's choice.
    * Displays the outcome of each round (win, lose, or tie).
    * Prompts the user to continue playing or exit the game.

# How to Play:
    * Clone the repository or download the Java file.
    * Compile the Java file using a Java compiler.
    * Run the compiled program to start playing Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
    * Follow the prompts to make your choice and see the result of each round.
